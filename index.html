My favorite languages/frameworks are: Typescript, Node.js, and python. I am the IT Specialist, as well as an EMT-Basic at UMass EMS. As IT specialist I created and maintain a website for both internal and external use. I work with management to create new software solutions to institutional problems. I am also an Undergraduate Researcher at the Gierasch Lab. My research involves using machine learning and biochemical techniques to derive folding properties of particular proteins in E. coli. To derive these properties, I design and perform biochemical experiments then analyze the results of those experiments and others using machine learning techniques. Currently, I am a senior at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I am writing a thesis about my research which is the final requirement I must fill to graduate with Commonwealth Multidisciplinary Honors. Though I have found a way to tie my lab work into my academic requirements my position in the lab is a professional position not strictly a class. I have also completed the requirements of the Pre-Medicine Track. I am on track to graduate in May of 2017. Though I originally chose my computer science major to differentiate myself from other medical school applicants I quickly fell in love with the subject and decided to forgo medical school and make computer science my primary focus. I am currently looking for industry jobs in software development or data analysis. In the future I might also pursue a PhD in computer science focusing on artificial intelligence/machine learning but I plan to obtain significant industry experience beforehand.</p><p>I created this website to serve as a central hub for my various accounts as well as showcase my experience and the projects I have completed. The pojects here are just a sample of what I have created in the last two years or so.</p></div></div><div class="center-flex" id="sites"><div><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/7224142/morsecodist" target="_blank"><div class="site-box" id="stackoverflow"><h3>Stack Overflow</h3><img src="https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/company/img/logos/so/so-icon.png?v=c78bd457575a"></div></a></div><div><a href="https://github.com/morsecodist" target="_blank"><div class="site-box" id="github"><h3>Github</h3><img src="https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/iconsimple-logotypes/512/github-512.png"></div></a></div><div><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-morse-496a1b5b?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile" target="_blank"><div class="site-box" id="linkedin"><h3>LinkedIn</h3><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/LinkedIn_logo_initials.png"></div></a></div></div></div></body></html>
